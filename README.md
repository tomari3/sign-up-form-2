# Sign-up form 2.

    As my last project had pitfalls with clean code, code efficiency and responsive design. This one comes to do better at those tasks.
    This time the design inspiration comes from dribbble by someone named Kuba Zelichowski:

    even comes with a mobile version, including great user affirmation.
